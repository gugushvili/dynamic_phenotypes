This repository contains computer code for: 

Shota Gugushvili, George A. K. van Voorn, Martin P. Boer, Daniela Bustos-Korts, Sandra Huynh Truong, Nicholas A. Friedenberg, Ryan McCormick, Scott Chapman, Carlos D. Messina,
and Fred A. van Eeuwijk, *A hierarchical Bayesian model for dynamic phenotypes in multi-environment trials with genotype by environment interaction*.

The code is given in `log_logistic_full_code.R` and is documented to an extent. The files also include optionally a large `brmsfit` object saved under the name `fit_brms.RDS` (ca. 2 Gb). This contains the model fit and is convenient to use to recreate figures and tables in the article, without an explicit need to refit the model.

To cite the repository, please cite the original article and provide a link to the repository.
